# FASCBALL!
### a 2 vs 2 game of football

The game is inspired by a workshop on fascism in South America. I had realized that many of the tactics used by fascists in South America very much resembled the ones used by "nationalists" in the Middle-East. I remembered football ("soccer" in U.S.A.) was something both areas of the world also shared. And so was born FASCball: A game of football against the fasc, where you play football, and they have guns.

Of course, the project has expanded a bit beyond its original premise (and will continue in the future), but the core idea is here.

### Controls
Move the players using the WASD (Player 1) and arrow keys (Player 2), or using the analog or d-pad input on a controller.
You can use the K (Player 1), Spacebar (Player 2), or any face buttons on a controller to kick, although it doesn't have any actual impact on the game (as of this writing).

**Content Warning** The game features many code-words and dog-whistles used by bigots to justify their actions. These include racist, sexist, antisemitic, islamophobic, homophobic, transphobic words and acts.

They are presented here as a way to expose their hateful rhetoric, but please be mindful of your well-being
